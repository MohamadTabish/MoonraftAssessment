# Moonraft Project-Fake Image Detection
# Overveiw
This project implements a fake image detection system utilizing the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. The model is fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to achieve optimal performance in distinguishing real and fake images.
# Introduction
Detecting fake or manipulated images has become increasingly challenging due to advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project aims to develop an effective fake image detection system using the VGG16 model and fine-tuning techniques with hyperparameter optimization.
# Model Selection
The VGG16 model, a popular pre-trained CNN architecture, is chosen as the base model. This model is then fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization to improve performance in fake image detection.
# Data Preprocessing
The dataset, containing both real and fake images, is preprocessed to ensure consistency and uniformity. The preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the data for training.
# Usage
To use the model for fake image detection, follow these steps: 
-Preprocess your dataset using the provided preprocessing scripts.
-Fine-tune the VGG16 model using hyperparameter optimization as demonstrated in the provided code.
-Train the model and evaluate its performance.
-Save the best model for future use.
